# 🌸 Iris Dataset – ML Practice

Basic machine learning practice using the Iris dataset with preprocessing and classification models.

## 📂 Dataset Info
- 150 samples, 4 features (sepal & petal length/width)
- 3 classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

## 🧠 Workflow
- Standard Scaling (Before vs After comparison)
- Feature Variance Analysis
- Models Applied:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluation:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy Score

## 📈 Observations
- Feature distribution changes before & after scaling
- Decision Tree performed better than Logistic on this dataset

## 🚀 Status: Completed
